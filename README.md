# sqdlib

Squid Libray - the standard library for the [Night](https://github.com/DynamicSquid/Night) language. It's still in active development, and closely evolves with Night.

This library is designed to be used with *[dusk](https://github.com/firefish111/dusk)*, the package manager for Night. Big thanks to [@firefish111](https://github.com/firefish111) for making it!

Note: This library reflects Night `v3.3`, which has not been released yet.
