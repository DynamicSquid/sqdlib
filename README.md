Squid Library - the standard library for Night

Note that this library reflects `Night v3.3`, which has not been released yet. But when it comes out, it should be fully compatable. Also might add a package manager in there as well with the help of [firefish111](https://github.com/firefish111) and [Lethdev2019](https://github.com/Lethdev2019).
